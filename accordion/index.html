            The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup
            language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It
            defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often
            assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
            scripting languages such as JavaScript.

            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
            describing the presentation of a document written in a markup
            language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
            MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide
            Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

            JavaScript is a programming language that is one of the core
            technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of
            2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for
            webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.

            React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source
            front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on
            components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a
            community of individual developers and companies. React can be used
            to develop single-page.
